            <ul className="list-disc mb-2">
                <li>Your ship NFT utilizes a new type of smart contract standard (EIP-6551) aka <Link href="https://tokenbound.org/" className="text-link">Token Bound NFTs </Link>  
                that allows the NFT itself to act as a smart wallet and OWN other tokens.</li>
                <li> This new functionality is leveraged to allow your ship to own its staked ETH, AMMO and GALAXY TOKENS and to interact with the smart contract on your behalf.</li>
                <li>Beware this means that if you sell your ship, you sell all your game inventory and characteristics.</li>
                <li> As owner of your ship you can always transfer tokens between your ship NFT and your wallet. However traits like Exp remain attributed to your wallet permanently.

                <li className = "text-red-600">This Game is currently unaudited, you may lose what you put in. Once funds are available an audit will be completed.</li>
                <li>Barring a smart contract bug, your Eth stake and {GOV_TOKEN.symbol}s should be safe, but your ships Ammo is always at risk.</li>
                <li>If you sell your ship, all your coins and Exp will be transferred.</li>
                <li>If you buy a ship on a public market beware that the tokens held in the ship may be withdrawn right before the transfer is complete. 
                  The Exp points will remain associated to the ship. Markets are currently working on a solution to this new issue introduced by the new Token Bound account contracts.</li>
