            <ul className="list-disc mb-2">
                <li>Your ship NFT utilizes a new type of smart contract standard (EIP-6551) aka <Link href="https://tokenbound.org/" className="text-link">Token Bound NFTs</Link> that allows the NFT itself to act as a smart wallet and OWN
                  other tokens. This new functionality is leveraged to allow your ship to own its staked ETH, AMMO and GALAXY TOKENS and to interact with the smart contract on your behalf.
                  Beware this means that if you sell your ship, you sell all your game inventory and charactieristics. As owner of your ship you can always transfer tokens between your 
                  ship NFT and your wallet. However traits like Exp remain attributed to your wallet permanently.
